<!-- Actual text -->

ðŸŒ± I'm currently studying towards the CFA charterholder. I am a CFA Level 2 Candidate. I enjoy writing code in Python and C++. During the week I work with Investment Management clients and build quantitative research workflows for them at S&P. On weekends I like to indulge myself in creating quant research projects in different areas of Quantitative Finance.
